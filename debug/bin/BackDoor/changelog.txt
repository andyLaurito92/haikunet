version 0.1
 The modules has basic functionality but it has some issues still:
	* The module is not thread-safe, meaning that if Scilab is doing someting else (like running another script) and the module tries to access a Scilab variable
	the module and Scilab will probably crash.
	* The module is not always returning the right anwser. Sometimes the ans var is not defined. 
	* UDP support is still not implemented
  * Windows version is not yet done
